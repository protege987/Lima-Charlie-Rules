# Lima-Charlie-Rules
Repository for test Lima Charlie Rules as part of home Lab
Goal is to have generic rules that can used and modified to various use cases
Using this as a learning method to understand more about logs, mitre tactics and techniques

Current Home lab setup:
1 windows 11 dev vm (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/)
This vmware can be use even if your computer does not meet windows 11 requirements as the vm is already setup
1 Ubuntu server which is used for Sliver framework (https://ubuntu.com/download/server#downloads)
Atomic red team which is an add-on within Lima Charlie but can be ran manually on windows vm
Using VMware pro to manage these vms
